# Student Marks Sorting using Bubble Sort

This Java program sorts students by their marks in **descending order** using the Bubble Sort algorithm. It ensures that the student names stay aligned with their respective marks after sorting.

---

## Features

- Sorts student marks from highest to lowest.
- Keeps student names synchronized with their marks.
- Uses the classic Bubble Sort algorithm with nested loops.
- Prints the sorted list of students with their marks.

## How It Works

The program maintains two parallel arrays:

- `names` — holds student names.
- `marks` — holds their corresponding marks.

During sorting, whenever two marks are swapped, the program also swaps the corresponding names to maintain correct association.
